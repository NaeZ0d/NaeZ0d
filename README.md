## 💼 About Me

I'm a dedicated IT and cybersecurity student with four years of combined academic training and real-world experience in technical support, system administration, and hardware deployment. I've supported a range of IT operations, from restoring network outages to assisting in large-scale device rollouts, and I enjoy applying what I learn to solve real-world problems and improve systems in meaningful ways, as well as contribute to the teams I find myself on.

Currently, I work as a Help Desk Specialist at an MSP, where I provide technical support across various platforms and environments to multiple organizations. In addition to my support duties, I serve as the main point of contact for one of our key clients, managing communication, addressing issues directly, and ensuring smooth coordination between our teams.

I'm deeply interested in security operations and actively developing my skills in security monitoring, threat analysis, and network defense through COREMESH, my self-built enterprise lab designed to connect certification learning with real-world, hands-on experience.
