## 💼 About Me

I am a dedicated IT professional and cybersecurity student with four years of combined academic training and hands-on experience in technical support, system administration, and hardware deployment. I have supported a wide range of IT operations, from restoring network outages to assisting with large-scale device rollouts, and I thrive on applying my skills to solve real-world problems, optimize systems, and contribute meaningfully to the teams I work with.

Currently, I serve as a Help Desk Analyst at a university hospital, providing technical support across multiple platforms and environments for staff and clinicians. I act as a primary point of contact for various technical issues, managing communication, resolving problems efficiently, and ensuring smooth coordination across teams.

I am deeply interested in cybersecurity, particularly in security operations, threat analysis, and network defense. I actively develop these skills through COREMESH, my self-built enterprise lab, which bridges certification learning with practical, hands-on experience in monitoring, detection, and defense in a simulated enterprise environment.
